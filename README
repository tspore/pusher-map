# Pusher - Google Map App 

This is a small mockup of having peoples ip's displayed onto a map. So as they log onto my site there ip address is parsed to a ISP IP address, from their it is translated into geocordinates. Afterwards that is sent and displayed onto a map. 

Currently it give 3 ip's - LA, NY, and a third random ip, if the development domain is localhost.
